# Packet Labs Github Best Practices

[![Build Status](https://cloud.drone.io/api/badges/jmarhee/github-repo-practices/status.svg)](https://cloud.drone.io/jmarhee/github-repo-practices)

All repositories should contain:

- a README with a clear statement of purpose
- Documentation (either a wiki, or contained within the README) for usage, requirements, etc.
- Test status (see `.drone.yml` for a baseline test-- this should, at the very least, validate that it passes a `markdownlint`)
